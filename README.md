Satellite identification script for astronomical images from the Dragonfly Telephto Array. The script is written in Python and utilizes the [astropy](https://www.astropy.org) package for the import and data acquisition of FITS images in addition to celestial coordinate to pixel space transformations. The [numpy](https://numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) packages are utilized for mathematical computations and graphics respectively. Satellite positions and other ephemerides are calculated with the [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) package.
